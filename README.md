A (bad) tetris clone in Love2D


This was mostly me putting myself out of my comfort zone. I felt like that on a lot of things I program I am too reliant on using google and using code from online to solve my problem and not understanding the actual solution. Here, I created a clone of tetris without looking at or using any code from google (atleast for the core stuff, I have third party code for stuff like random number generation) and implementing my own solutions to problems I came across.

Though, due to this, it isn't a very good clone. I don't have any sort of fancy randomizer for the tetris pieces (I just use a class I found online for generating random numbers) and there's also a litany of bugs such as you being able to sometimes clip into geometry by rotating at certain points. The controls are also pretty unresponsive and clunky.

Despite that however, I feel like this was an extremely useful learning experience. I feel more comfortable tackling problems without relying on google for support which helps be better understand how to go about programming solutions and the thought process behind creating one.
